# Real-time Transaction & Audit Log System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a secure peer-to-peer fund transfer system with an immutable audit log.  
It simulates real-world transaction handling where money is transferred atomically between users and every transaction is permanently recorded for auditing purposes.

The system is designed with a strong focus on **data consistency, security, and reliability**, following backend engineering best practices.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Prisma ORM**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **Plain HTML + JavaScript** frontend

---

## ✨ Features

### Backend
- User registration and login
- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Atomic fund transfer using database transactions
- Immutable audit log for every transaction
- Authenticated API to fetch transaction history

### Frontend
- Simple transfer form (receiver ID & amount)
- JWT-based authenticated requests
- Real-time update of transaction history after transfer
- Tabular view of audit logs

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### User
- `id`
- `name`
- `email` (unique)
- `password` (hashed)
- `balance`

### TransactionAudit
- `id`
- `senderId`
- `receiverId`
- `amount`
- `status`
- `timestamp`

---

## 🔐 API Endpoints

### Register User


POST /auth/register


### Login User


POST /auth/login


### Transfer Funds (Atomic Transaction)


POST /transfer
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>


### Fetch Transaction History


GET /audit
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Backend

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Environment Variables

Create a .env file inside the Backend folder:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/transaction_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5000

4️⃣ Run Database Migrations
.\node_modules\.bin\prisma migrate dev

5️⃣ Start Backend Server
node src/server.js


Server runs at:

http://localhost:5000

🌐 Frontend Usage

Navigate to:

Frontend/index.html


Open it in a browser

Paste a valid JWT token

Enter receiver ID and amount

Click Transfer

Transaction history updates instantly

🧪 Testing

APIs tested using VS Code REST Client

Database verified using Prisma Studio

Frontend tested via browser

🧠 Engineering Highlights

Uses database transactions to ensure atomic debit & credit

Prevents partial updates and inconsistent balances

Maintains immutable audit logs

Clear separation of backend and frontend logic

AI-assisted generation of transaction boilerplate and frontend structure
